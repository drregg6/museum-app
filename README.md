## General info
This project is created as a toy app to practice React and Redux. I wanted to play with an API and see how to interact between React and that API, while maintaining state using Redux. Users can interact with the API by searching for an artist or a piece of painting. The API will return results and render the pieces of artwork with the artist's name beneath it (I tried to make it look like a frame). The user can click a piece for more information, such as the artist's full name, description (if available), and the date.

_No longer continued_ although I would like to jump back in and revamp for a v2.0, it is not on my TODO list. v1.0 is _Launched_ [here](https://lit-beach-33230.herokuapp.com/)

## Inspiration
I needed an API to play with. As an art history major, I scoured through some museums until I found a public API!
